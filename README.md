# how-many-signal

## What is this?
This is a medicine timer web application I made for my wife who needs to apply three types of eye drops at 5-minute intervals but cannot remember how many types of eye drops she applies.

## Where can I use this app?
how-many-signal.pages.dev

## It seems to be specialized for a specific purpose, but I think it could be a little more general-purpose.
You're right. If there are people who want to use it, I would be happy to make it more general. I welcome your opinions on how to make it more general and what features to add. Thank you for your [issue report](https://github.com/UedaTakeyuki/how-many-signal/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/UedaTakeyuki/how-many-signal/pulls).
